# bulk-sharedmatches
Powershell script to partially-automate the opening of shared DNA matches on [Ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com)

This is to aid anyone using the [Leeds Method](https://www.danaleeds.com/the-leeds-method/) to categorise DNA matches.
I have written this to minimise the number of keyboard presses and mouse clicks to open a batch of relatives profile pages
in seperate browser tabs, then browse to the shared matches section of each person's page.
